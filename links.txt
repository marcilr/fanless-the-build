ECC memory
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
"ECC DIMMs typically have nine memory chips on each side,
one more than usually found on non-ECC DIMMs (some modules
may have 5 or 18).[1]  Error-correcting code memory (ECC memory)
is a type of computer data storage that can detect and correct
the most common kinds of internal data corruption. ECC memory is
used in most computers where data corruption cannot be tolerated
under any circumstances, such as for scientific or financial
computing."
